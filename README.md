Siad PDF Compressor is a PHP utility to compress PDF documents generated by [Siad](https://www.sigao.it/default.asp) software, via [iLovePDF](https://www.ilovepdf.com) Api.

> Siad is and Italian software, running on Windows, so this utility is developed for Italian marketplace and Windows operating system (even if it runs perfectly on Linux, too)


## Pre-Requisites

1.  A [PHP](https://www.php.net) installation.
2.  An [IlovePDF Api](https://developer.ilovepdf.com/) account.


## Installation

Dowload the latest version of the `.phar` archive, from the official [Github repository](https://github.com/cristianoc72/siad-pdf-compressor/releases)



## Configuration

Run:

```bash
php pdf-compressor.phar init

```

and follow the instructions.
The program will ask you for the directory, containing the documents to compress, and the public and private key to access to IlovePDF Api.

Alternatively, you can edit by hand the `.env` configuration file, which resides into your `home` directory (`C:\Users\<your-username>` on Windows).

## Basic Usage

To compress the documents run:

```bash
php pdf-compressor.phar compress
```
The program creates a backup copy of the document, called `Original_<your-document-name>`, then compress it.


You can restore the original documents by running:

```bash
php pdf-compressor.phar revert
```
